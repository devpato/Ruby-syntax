# Ruby-syntax
This are some personal notes I made for whoever wants to learn Ruby. *NOTE* this notes do not contain anything right now related with rails. rails is a framework used by ruby.

*if you would like to contribute to this repository please email me at pevargas@valdosta.edu to add you and we can make this repo better for anyone that would like to learn ruby.*

*NOTE* I'm not an expert in Ruby, I'm still learning it, so if you see any mistake in my notes please let me know.
